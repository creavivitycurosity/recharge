# Future Charge Manipulation Demo Portal

A standalone customer portal demonstrating the **future charge manipulation** feature to merchant partners. It is a reference implementation of what a merchant would build against the Recharge API directly.

> **Connecting your own store?** This README is the high-level overview. For the full step-by-step setup, token creation, and deployment walkthrough, see **[STORE_SETUP.md](STORE_SETUP.md)**.

## Purpose

This portal is **an example merchants can fork and follow to build their own custom customer portal**. It shows one concrete, end-to-end way to surface multiple queued charges, per-delivery bundle editing, and customer self-service on top of the Recharge API and the Shopify Admin API.

It is built around two complementary surfaces:

- **Merchant admin portal** (`/merchant`) — where the merchant curates what customers can choose from for each upcoming charge. The merchant picks the active bundle product, assigns Shopify collections to upcoming delivery weeks (the bundle selection schedule), sets per-week defaults, and configures the delivery-date offset, modification/lock window, and add-on collections. This is how a merchant defines the upcoming menu and the rules that govern customer choices.
- **Customer portal** (`/login` → `/<customerId>`) — where each customer manages their own upcoming charges. After passwordless sign-in, a customer sees their queued charges grouped by delivery week and can make their selections for each charge independently: edit the bundle contents from the merchant's scheduled collections, set dietary exclusions, and skip or unskip a week — all within the modification window the merchant configured.

It is a **demo / reference implementation, not a turnkey hosted product.** A merchant adopting it is expected to take the code as a starting point and run it on their own infrastructure. The portal ships with everything wired up against a single store via environment variables — there is no multi-tenant layer.

### What you provide yourself

A merchant standing this up owns the following (see [STORE_SETUP.md](STORE_SETUP.md) for the how-to):

- **Web hosting** — the portal is a long-running Node.js server, so it needs a persistent host (e.g. Railway, Render, Fly.io, a VPS). Serverless platforms (Vercel/Netlify) don't fit because merchant config is written to disk under `data/`. A custom domain plus DNS/SSL is also yours to set up — see STORE_SETUP.md → *Hosting on a Domain*.
- **Persistent storage for merchant config** — the `data/*.json` files (merchant settings, week assignments, bundle defaults, add-on collections) live on disk, so a hosted deployment must mount a persistent volume at `data/`.
- **A Recharge store** with the `enable_future_charge_manipulation` / `enable_multiple_active_queued_charges` beta flags enabled, at least one bundle subscription product, and a test customer with active subscriptions and queued charges.
- **Recharge API tokens** — both a **Merchant** API key (server-side admin) and a **Storefront** access token (passwordless customer login).
- **A Shopify app** with the client-credentials grant and the required product/customer scopes.
- **Branding** — replace `public/logo.png` with your own logo.

## What It Does

The Future Charge Manipulations feature lets a single subscription have up to `max_queued_charges` (system max: 6) QUEUED charges at once, gated behind the `enable_future_charge_manipulation` / `enable_multiple_active_queued_charges` beta flags.

Built on top of that, the portal provides:

- **Passwordless login** — customers sign in with an email verification code (Recharge storefront flow); no password.
- **Delivery dashboard** — upcoming queued charges grouped by week, with the bundle contents for each.
- **Skip / unskip** queued charges per week.
- **Edit bundle selections** per queued charge independently.
- **Dietary preferences** — exclude-only ("Ingredients to Avoid"), stored as Shopify customer tags (see below).
- **Account page** — view/update address and payment method.
- **Order history** — previously charged orders.
- **Merchant admin portal** (`/merchant`) — pick the active bundle, assign Shopify collections to weeks, configure delivery offset and modification windows, and set up add-on collections.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | [Remix](https://remix.run/) 2.16 (Vite, SSR) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Auth | [`@rechargeapps/storefront-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rechargeapps/storefront-client) (passwordless email-code login) |
| Validation | Zod (schema-validates all API responses) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Runtime | Node.js 18+ |

API calls are made server-side only — neither the Recharge API key nor the Shopify credentials are ever exposed to the browser.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Recharge store (staging recommended for testing) with the beta flags above
- A Recharge **Merchant** API key and a **Storefront** access token (Recharge API version `2021-11`)
- A Shopify app (client-credentials grant) installed on the store

Detailed token/scope setup lives in **[STORE_SETUP.md](STORE_SETUP.md)**.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in `.env`. All variables:

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `RECHARGE_API_KEY` | **Yes** | Merchant API key. Keys look like `sk_1x1_...`. |
| `RECHARGE_API_URL` | No | Recharge API base URL. Defaults to `https://api.rechargeapps.com`. |
| `RECHARGE_ADMIN_URL` | No | Your Recharge admin URL, e.g. `https://your-store.admin.rechargeapps.com`. Falls back to `RECHARGE_API_URL` if unset. |
| `RECHARGE_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN` | **Yes** | Storefront token for passwordless login. Must start with `strfnt`. |
| `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` | **Yes** | Shopify store domain, e.g. `your-store.myshopify.com`. |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID` | **Yes** | Client ID of the Shopify client-credentials app. |
| `SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | **Yes** | Client secret (`shpss_...`) of the Shopify app. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | **Yes** | Secret used to sign the session cookie. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |

> The app **requires** `SESSION_SECRET` and `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` to start. The remaining required values throw on first use (first API call or first login). `RECHARGE_API_URL` and `RECHARGE_ADMIN_URL` have sensible defaults. `PORT` is read automatically by `remix-serve` in production — most hosts set it for you.

For where to find each value (creating the Recharge tokens, configuring the Shopify app and its scopes, generating `SESSION_SECRET`), follow **[STORE_SETUP.md](STORE_SETUP.md)**.

## Running

```bash
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:5173
```

You'll be redirected to `/login` first — sign in with the email of a customer on your store. For production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start          # remix-serve; reads PORT
```

## Customer Dietary Preferences

Preferences are **exclude-only** and stored as **Shopify customer tags** — there is no local database or JSON file for them. Each excluded ingredient is a tag of the form `rc_exclude_<slug>` (e.g. `rc_exclude_eggs`) on the customer's linked Shopify record. The slug is matched case-insensitively against Shopify **product** tags (underscores map to spaces). Because they live in Shopify, preferences survive deploys and scale with the store automatically — no volume or migration needed. See [STORE_SETUP.md → *Customer Dietary Preferences*](STORE_SETUP.md#customer-dietary-preferences-shopify-customer-tags) for details.

## APIs Used

**Recharge API** — all calls use header `X-Recharge-Access-Token` and `X-Recharge-Version: 2021-11`:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/customers/:id` | Customer header info (incl. `external_customer_id.ecommerce` Shopify link) |
| GET | `/subscriptions?customer_id=:id` | Active subscription list |
| GET | `/charges?customer_id=:id&status=queued` | Queued charges (also `skipped`, `success` views) |
| POST | `/charges/:id/skip` · `/charges/:id/unskip` | Skip / unskip a queued charge |
| GET / PUT | `/bundle-selections` | Read / update bundle selections per charge |
| GET | `/addresses/:id`, `/payment-methods`, `/onetimes`, credit summaries | Account & dashboard data |
| GET / PUT | preset-schedule endpoints | Week assignments for the merchant portal |

`/bundle-selections` and preset schedules are Recharge Plus / Bundles features.

**Shopify Admin API** (`https://<store>/admin/api/2025-01`, client-credentials token) — fetches collection products and reads/writes customer tags:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/products.json`, `/collects.json`, `/custom_collections.json` | Bundle/collection products for the item picker |
| GET | `/customers/:id.json?fields=id,tags` | Read dietary-preference tags |
| PUT | `/customers/:id.json` | Write dietary-preference tags (preserves other tags) |

Required Shopify scopes: `read_products`, `read_product_listings`, `read_customers`, `write_customers`.
